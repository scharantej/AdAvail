### Flask Application Design

**Problem:** Build a website that utilizes PHP to power an advertising network, allowing publishers to sign up and obtain HTML ad codes.

### Application Structure

#### HTML Files

- **signup.html:** Form for publishers to register and provide necessary information.
- **dashboard.html:** Publishers' dashboard displaying their ad codes and analytics.
- **ad.html:** HTML code block for publishers to embed on their websites to display ads.

#### Routes

- **@app.route('/signup', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: Handles publisher sign-ups by processing form submissions.
- **@app.route('/dashboard', methods=['GET'])**: Displays the publisher's dashboard.
- **@app.route('/ad', methods=['GET'])**: Generates an HTML ad code based on the publisher's information.

**Explanation:**
- **signup.html** allows new publishers to register and provides them with an account to access their dashboard and ad codes.
- **dashboard.html** serves as the main interface for publishers after they log in, enabling them to manage their account and track their ad performance.
- **ad.html** generates the HTML code that publishers can embed on their websites to display the ads.
- The **@app.route('/signup')** route processes the registration form data and creates a new publisher account if everything is valid.
- The **@app.route('/dashboard')** route authenticates publishers, allowing them access to their dashboard.
- The **@app.route('/ad')** route generates the dynamic HTML code for ad display based on the publisher's preferences or information stored in the database.
